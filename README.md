# MDLecturesWKMBP2020

This repository contains the lecture Materials for the Molecular Dynamics section (2nd part) of the TU Dresden physics course **"Numerics and Computer Simulations in Soft Condensed Matter"**.

There is also a [website](http://www.ipfdd.de/de/scmbp/soft-condensed-matter-and-biological-physics/numerik-und-computersimulationen-in-der-weichen-kondensierten-materie/) for this lecture.

Here, you find the materials (jupyter-notebooks, LAMMPS and Python scripts), and worksheets.

The first part (Introduction and Monte Carlo Methods) of this series of lectures, given by [Martin Wengenmayr](https://github.com/MartinWenge), can be found [here](https://github.com/MartinWenge/LectureWKMBP2020).

## Requirements

### For lectures 1 and 2

 - Python3 with numpy, matplotlib and pandas (best way is to install anaconda)
 - Jupyter notebook

### For lectures 3 and later

In addition to using Python scripts for analysis, we are working with:
 - [LAMMPS](https://lammps.sandia.gov/download.html) (3Mar2020 or later)
 - VMD or [Ovito](https://www.ovito.org/) for visualization (optional)
